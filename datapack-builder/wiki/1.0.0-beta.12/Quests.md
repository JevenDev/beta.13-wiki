# Quests

Quest module v2 is the preferred shape for new quest datapacks. A v2 module can define the provider, availability, lifecycle, stages, objectives, dialogue, responses, transitions, events, rewards, and tracker UI in one file.

Legacy v1 quest files are still supported. Keep existing v1 packs working, but use v2 for new simple quests and for migrations where you want dialogue and quest state to live together.

## Paths

```text
data/<namespace>/quests/<quest>.json
data/<namespace>/quests/<module>/<quest>.json
```

The folder path is for organization and overrides. It does not create a questline by itself.

## One-File Quest

This is a complete playable quest. It needs no external dialogue tree.

## Main Parts

| Section | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `schema` | Must be `villagerretaliation:quest/v2` for v2 modules |
| `id` | Stable quest resource id used by saves, commands, dialogue, and overrides |
| `metadata` | Player-facing title, description, questline, tags, and parent |
| `provider` | Who can offer or own the quest |
| `availability` | Repeat limits, abandonment, cooldowns, locking, and active gates |
| `target` | Optional world target such as a structure search |
| `entry_stage` | First stage id |
| `stages` | Objectives, stage-local dialogue, responses, scenes, events, and UI |
| `events` | Quest-level triggers that run while the quest exists |
| `rewards` | XP, reputation, gossip, loot, memory events, or reward actions |
| `ui` | Tracker text, icon, progress, placeholders, color, and priority |
| `external_scenes` | Optional external dialogue scene resources used by this module |

Provider objects may set `death_protection` to `none` (default), `while_active`, or `after_start`. `while_active` protects only the exact bound provider UUID while a qualifying run remains active. `after_start` begins only after successful durable quest startup and remains on that villager after completion, failure, expiration, or abandonment; merely showing an offer does not apply it.

## Dialogue And Scenes

Stage `dialogue` slots normally use these names:

| Slot | When it appears |
| --- | --- |
| `offer` | Quest can be started |
| `reminder` | Quest is active but not ready |
| `turn_in` | Objectives are complete |
| `already_completed` | Player already completed a non-repeatable quest |
| `unavailable` | Provider is known but availability gates fail |
| `inactive` | Accepted quest is paused by active conditions |
| `missing_target`, `missing_proof`, `locate_failed` | Target/proof helper states |

Inline scenes stay inside the quest module. Use `external` or `external_scene` only when the scene is large, shared, localized separately, or deliberately owned by another datapack resource.

## Transition Rules

Keep each response to one transition source. Pick one of:

- direct response fields such as `next`, `stage`, `scene`, `complete`, `abandon`, or `fail`
- a `transition` object with `stage`, `scene`, `response`, `complete`, `abandon`, or `fail`
- a transition action such as `quest_transition`

Do not combine direct transition fields with a transition action on the same response. Put side effects, such as `set_variable`, `notification`, or `reputation`, in `actions`, then put the single stage or scene move in `transition`.

## Branch Example

This module records a route choice, moves to the chosen stage, and completes from either branch.

## Structure Target Example

Root `target` fields define a structure search, discovery radius, and proof item. Stages can combine a visit objective with a proof-item objective.

              }
            }
          ]
        }
      ]

## Forced Or External Scene Example

Use external scenes when another file owns a long conversation. Use `forced_dialogue` actions when the quest needs an event-driven locked scene. These actions need live player and provider context; if the quest giver is unloaded, the runtime records diagnostics and waits until it can safely run the live action.

          "label": "I will listen for it.",
          "actions": [
            {
              "type": "set_variable",
              "scope": "quest",
              "key": "choice",
              "value": "heard"
            }
          ],
          "end": true
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The forced quest scene above can live in `data/my_pack/forced_dialogue/quests/lost_civilization/storm_warning.json`:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "quest": "my_pack:storm_warning",
    "questline": "lost_civilization"
  },
  "entries": [
    {
      "id": "my_pack.quest.storm_warning.reminder",
      "trigger": "quest",
      "output": {
        "mode": "forced_dialogue"
      },
      "lines": [
        "Storms make old warnings easier to hear. Stay close to shelter."
      ],
      "requires_line_of_sight": true,
      "force_camera_towards_villager": true,
      "options": [
        {
          "id": "my_pack.quest.storm_warning.ok",
          "label": "I understand.",
          "response": "Then keep the warning near your feet.",
          "end_conversation": true
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Localization

Inline text is a fallback. Use `*_key` fields when you want datapack-localized text:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "title": "Bread Delivery",
    "title_key": "quest.my_pack.bread_delivery.title",
    "description": "Bring 16 bread.",
    "description_key": "quest.my_pack.bread_delivery.description"
  },
  "ui": {
    "tracker_text": "Bring 16 bread.",
    "tracker_text_key": "quest.my_pack.bread_delivery.tracker"
  }
}
```

Dialogue slots and scenes also accept `text_key`, `label_key`, and keyed lines where the generated schema lists them. Put keyed text in normal dialogue message files under `data/<namespace>/dialogue/<locale>/.../messages/*.json`.

## Capabilities And Live Context

Conditions and actions come from the generated quest registries. The datapack builder reads `tools/datapack-builder/quest-registry-metadata.json`; the Node validator and Java schema generator use the same runtime metadata.

Some registry entries need live entities:

- provider-live conditions, such as villager equipment or live mood checks, need the quest giver loaded
- player-live actions, such as notifications, forced dialogue, loot, XP, and reputation changes, need a player context
- provider-live actions, such as forced dialogue and gossip, need the issuing villager loaded

Prefer saved-state conditions for active quest gates that must continue while the villager is unloaded. Use live-context actions from events only when the event is expected to run near the player and provider.

## Diagnostics And Trace Commands

Useful commands while testing:

```text
/villagerretaliation datapack diagnostics
/villagerretaliation quest debug providers [radius]
/villagerretaliation quest debug why_available <quest_id> <provider_name>
/villagerretaliation quest debug why_hidden <quest_id> [provider_name]
/villagerretaliation quest debug inspect <quest_id>
/villagerretaliation quest debug objectives <quest_id>
/villagerretaliation quest debug trace on
/villagerretaliation quest debug trace show [limit]
/villagerretaliation quest debug trace capture <quest_id> <provider_name>
/villagerretaliation quest debug fire_trigger <quest_id> <event>
/villagerretaliation quest debug actions dry_run <quest_id> <trigger_id>
```

Use `inspect` for saved state, issuer context, target context, repeat rules, objective counters, current stage, and fact values. Use `trace` for indexed trigger dispatch, condition traces, action diagnostics, and bounded recent events.

## Legacy V1 Compatibility

V1 quest JSON remains supported when the file has no `schema: "villagerretaliation:quest/v2"`. V1 fields such as `display`, `offer`, top-level `objectives`, `rules`, `tracker`, `triggers`, and separate dialogue trees still load through the compatibility adapter.

Legacy override rules still apply:

- a higher-priority datapack can replace a built-in quest by writing the same quest id
- a v2 module can replace a v1 quest with the same id
- old dialogue tree resources under `data/<namespace>/dialogue_trees/<locale>/quests/...` still work
- `remove` and `replace` on dialogue trees still remove or replace legacy/extracted scenes

Do not delete v1 resources just because v2 exists. Migrate intentionally, validate the generated v2 file, and keep any external dialogue tree only when it is still needed.

## Extraction Guidance

Start with one v2 quest file. Extract only when the file becomes hard to maintain:

```text
data/<namespace>/quests/<module>/<quest>.json
data/<namespace>/dialogue_trees/<locale>/quests/<module>/<quest>.json
data/<namespace>/dialogue/<locale>/quests/<module>/<quest>/messages/*.json
data/<namespace>/forced_dialogue/quests/<module>/<quest>.json
```

Use the quest module for quest state, stages, objective readiness, rewards, transitions, and short scenes. Use external dialogue trees for long authored branches or shared localization. Use forced dialogue only for event-driven locked scenes outside the normal Talk flow.
