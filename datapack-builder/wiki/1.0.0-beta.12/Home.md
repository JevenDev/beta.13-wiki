# Villager Retaliation Wiki

This wiki documents the current `1.0.0-beta.12` pack surface for Villager Retaliation. It is written for datapack authors, resource-pack authors, and modpack maintainers who want concrete file paths, working JSON, and clear override rules.

Every page includes at least one copyable example. Start small, test one system at a time, and only add filters after the base hook works.

## Quick Start

1. Read [Pack Development](Pack-Development.md) for folder layout, namespaces, overrides, and testing.
2. Read [JSON Reference](JSON-Reference.md) for shared rules like `id`, `replace`, `text` vs `lines`, and conditions.
3. If you want to make a quest, start with [First Quest Guide](First-Quest.md).
4. Pick the system you want to customize from the table below.
5. Copy a working example from [Example Packs](Example-Packs.md) or the full template pack.

## Smallest Working Example

This is the smallest useful dialogue addon: one option and one reply.

```text
data/my_pack/dialogue/en_us/my_pack/options/00_rumor.json
data/my_pack/dialogue/en_us/my_pack/lines/00_rumor.json
```

```json
{
  "id": "my_pack.option.ask_rumor",
  "label": "Ask For A Rumor",
  "request": "story"
}
```

```json
{
  "id": "my_pack.line.rumor",
  "request": "story",
  "option": "my_pack.option.ask_rumor",
  "text": "Roads carry stories faster than traders do."
}
```

Run `/reload`, talk to a villager, and confirm the option appears.

## Recommended Reading Order

- [Pack Development](Pack-Development.md)
- [JSON Reference](JSON-Reference.md)
- [First Quest Guide](First-Quest.md) if you are making quests
- One of: [Dialogue](Dialogue.md), [Forced Dialogue](Forced-Dialogue.md), [Quests](Quests.md), [Notifications](Notifications.md), or [Builder Structures](Builder-Structures.md)
- [Example Packs](Example-Packs.md)
- [Pack Format Changes](Pack-Format-Changes.md) if you are updating an older pack

## Version Note

The builder also ships versioned wiki snapshots under `tools/datapack-builder/wiki/`. This repo wiki and the `1.0.0-beta.12` builder wiki should match. Older snapshots exist so beta.11 packs can keep their historical reference surface.
