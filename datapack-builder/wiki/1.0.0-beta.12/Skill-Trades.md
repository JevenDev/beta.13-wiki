# Skill Trades

Skill trades are extra merchant offers gated by a villager's Skills rather than only by vanilla trade level.

## Path

```text
data/<namespace>/skill_trades/<file>.json
```

## Minimal Entry

```json
{
  "entries": [
    {
      "id": "my_pack:cartographer_basic_map",
      "professions": ["minecraft:cartographer"],
      "skills": ["villagerretaliation:cartography"],
      "min_rank": "novice",
      "max_rank": "apprentice",
      "villager_level": 1,
      "chance": 0.8,
      "weight": 12,
      "cost": { "item": "minecraft:emerald", "count": 8 },
      "result": { "item": "minecraft:map", "count": 1 },
      "max_uses": { "base": 4 },
      "xp": 4,
      "price_multiplier": 0.05,
      "quality_scaling": true
    }
  ]
}
```

## Common Usage Areas

### Low-Skill Extra Stock

Use `min_rank` plus `max_rank` to keep a trade in the low tier only.

```json
"min_rank": "novice",
"max_rank": "apprentice"
```

### High-Skill Specialty Offer

```json
{
  "id": "my_pack:farmer_master_hoe",
  "professions": ["minecraft:farmer"],
  "skills": ["villagerretaliation:farming"],
  "min_rank": "master",
  "villager_level": 5,
  "cost": { "item": "minecraft:emerald", "count": 18 },
  "result": {
    "item": "minecraft:diamond_hoe",
    "count": 1
  },
  "conditions": {
    "config_flags": ["skillTradeAllowHighTierEquipment"]
  }
}
```

### Targetable Special Order

Beta.12 lets high-reputation players request specific skill trades directly.

```json
"request": {
  "targetable": true,
  "display_priority": 20,
  "min_reputation": "respected",
  "wait_days": 2,
  "cooldown_days": 3
}
```

### Wandering Trader Entry

Use the wandering trader profession id:

```json
{
  "id": "my_pack:wandering_trader_shell",
  "professions": ["minecraft:wandering_trader"],
  "skills": ["villagerretaliation:trading"],
  "min_rank": "master",
  "chance": 0.3,
  "cost": { "item": "minecraft:emerald", "count": 15 },
  "result": { "item": "minecraft:nautilus_shell", "count": 1 }
}
```

## Main Fields

| Field | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `professions` | Which villagers can roll the entry |
| `skills` | Which skill ids gate it |
| `min_rank` / `max_rank` | Skill rank band |
| `villager_level` | Vanilla trade level gate |
| `cost` | Input item and count |
| `result` | Output item and count |
| `chance` / `weight` | Selection tuning |
| `quality_scaling` | Rank-based improvements |
| `request` | Special Order metadata |

## Refresh Cycles

Each villager keeps a persistent cycle for its current profession. Random trade refreshes use weighted sampling without replacement: a larger `weight` makes an entry more likely to appear earlier, but every currently eligible definition is exposed at most once before the cycle resets. The last fulfilled definition is held across the boundary so a multi-entry pool cannot immediately repeat it.

Displayed results, definitions already reserved by another pending slot, entries that no longer match, and offers that cannot currently be constructed are skipped without stalling the cycle. `chance` still applies to initial natural trade generation; requested refresh cycles consider every otherwise eligible definition.

On a datapack reload, loaded villagers reconcile lazily the next time their trade state is used. Newly added definitions join the current remainder, removed or invalid definitions leave it, and valid pending requests keep their accepted definition and deterministic offer seed. A malformed or removed pending request is canceled independently so its slot and active-order reservation are cleared.

If a canceled Special Order was prepaid, the villager stores a refund claim for the player who paid. That player receives the items the next time they interact with the same villager; inventory overflow is dropped safely at the player, and a delivered claim cannot be paid twice.

## Authoring and Validation

The datapack builder has a **Skill Trades** section that imports and exports arbitrary namespaces and nested `skill_trades` paths without flattening them. Its JSON editor preserves supported advanced fields such as conditions, quality scaling, enchantments, and complete `request` metadata.

Validate a file offline with:

```text
node tools/validate-dialogue-data.mjs --skill-trade path/to/trades.json
```

The authoritative generated schema is `tools/datapack-builder/skill-trades.schema.json`. Runtime diagnostics identify the resource, entry index or id, field path, reason, and corrective guidance. Invalid siblings are skipped individually; valid entries in the same file continue loading. Duplicate ids resolve deterministically in resource load order, while `remove` deletes the definition currently associated with that id and root-level `replace` clears definitions loaded earlier.

## Best Practice

Model skill trades in bands:

- low tier for novice or apprentice villagers
- mid tier for skilled or expert villagers
- rare high tier for expert or master villagers

That gives progression without flooding early villagers with endgame stock.
