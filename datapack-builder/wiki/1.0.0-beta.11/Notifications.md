# Notifications JSON

Notifications JSON controls short HUD messages and ambient world text above villagers.

## Paths

Notification files must be in the `villagerretaliation` namespace and include a locale:

```text
data/villagerretaliation/notifications/en_us/my_pack_notifications.json
data/villagerretaliation/notifications/fr_fr/my_pack_notifications.json
```

The mod loads `en_us` first, then overlays the player's locale. Matching `id` values replace earlier definitions.

Use a unique file name for addon notifications. A datapack file at `data/villagerretaliation/notifications/en_us/global.json` replaces the mod's built-in `global.json`, which can hide default notification text. Only use that exact path when you intentionally want a full-file override.

Notification files translate HUD notification text and ambient world text. They do not translate the interaction GUI, generated relationship/family labels, reputation overlay labels, or villager chat tag labels. Put those strings in a resource-pack language file; see [Localization Guide](Localization.md).

Files are read in sorted resource-location order. A file with top-level `"replace": true` clears previously loaded notifications for that locale pool, then adds its own notifications. Use this only when a pack intentionally wants to replace the loaded notification/world-text pool instead of adding to it.

## Minimal Notification

```json
{
  "replace": false,
  "notifications": [
    {
      "id": "my_pack.gift.liked",
      "trigger": "gift.liked",
      "text": "Good gift: {item}",
      "kind": "gift_liked",
      "color": "green"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Text And Line Variations

Notification entries can use either `text` for one output or `lines` for several equal variations. The entry passes its filters and `chance`, then weighted selection chooses an entry, then one line variation is selected at random.

```json
{
  "notifications": [
    {
      "id": "my_pack.baby_hit_alert",
      "trigger": "alert.player_attacked_villager",
      "lines": [
        "Ow!",
        "Stop!",
        "Help!"
      ],
      "world_text_kind": "alert",
      "show_for_adults": false,
      "show_for_babies": true,
      "weight": 30
    }
  ]
}
```

Use `text` for single-line entries. Use `lines` when several entries would otherwise share the same trigger, filters, chance, and style.

## Add, Override, Or Replace

Most packs should add notification entries without `replace`. This keeps the built-in notifications and adds another possible line for the same trigger:

```json
{
  "notifications": [
    {
      "id": "examplepack.greeting.extra",
      "trigger": "dialogue.greeting",
      "text": "Well met.",
      "world_text_kind": "dialogue",
      "weight": 20
    }
  ]
}
```

To override one entry, use the same `id` as an existing entry. Later files replace earlier entries with the same id:

```json
{
  "notifications": [
    {
      "id": "examplepack.greeting.extra",
      "trigger": "dialogue.greeting",
      "text": "Good day.",
      "world_text_kind": "dialogue"
    }
  ]
}
```

Top-level `replace` is file-wide, not trigger-wide. This file removes the earlier notification pool, then adds only the listed notifications:

```json
{
  "replace": true,
  "notifications": [
    {
      "id": "examplepack.opening.only",
      "trigger": "conversation.opening",
      "lines": [
        "Hello.",
        "Good day.",
        "Need something?"
      ],
      "world_text_kind": "dialogue"
    }
  ]
}
```

After that example, earlier notification entries for `dialogue.greeting`, `trade.completed`, `gift.world.liked`, combat alerts, and every other notification trigger are gone unless this file also adds them back. Use `replace: true` for packs that want to own the whole notification/world-text set.

Quick choices:

| Goal | Use |
| --- | --- |
| Add another possible popup | No `replace`; add a notification with the same `trigger`. |
| Make your popup much more likely | No `replace`; add a higher `weight`. |
| Change one known entry | Reuse that entry's `id`. |
| Replace all loaded notifications with your own set | Top-level `"replace": true`, then include every notification you still want. |

Common trigger examples:

| What You Want To Change | Trigger |
| --- | --- |
| Floating text when opening a conversation, including fallback words like `Hai`, `Ciao`, and `Heyo` | `conversation.opening` |
| Floating text when closing a conversation | `conversation.closing` |
| Floating text after choosing Greet | `dialogue.greeting` |
| Floating text after asking a question | `dialogue.question` |
| Floating text after a completed trade | `trade.completed` |
| Floating text after a liked gift | `gift.world.liked` |
| Floating text after a disliked gift | `gift.world.disliked` |
| Floating text when a villager is attacked by a player | `alert.player_attacked_villager` |

## HUD Kinds

Use these values in `kind`:

```text
default
map_discovery
received_item
gift_liked
gift_neutral
gift_disliked
villager_following
villager_dismissed
villager_hired
villager_fired
villager_death
```

## World Text Kinds

`world_text_kind` controls the floating text's default color, size, motion, particles, and emphasis. It does not control when the text appears; the `trigger` and filters do that. Use `color` or `text_color` when you want the same behavior with a custom tint.

| Value | Default Use | What It Looks Like |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `alert` | Danger, attacks, retaliation, urgent warnings. | Largest and punchiest style. Uses warm yellow text by default, rises higher, pops harder, spawns alert particles, and adds an extra `!` accent when the text is more than just `!`. |
| `murmur` | Ambient nearby comments and low-importance chatter. | Small, quiet, pale text with gentle movement and no special particles. Best for background flavor. |
| `positive` | Approval, successful jokes, high-reputation gifts, good outcomes. | Green-tinted text with happy/glow particles and a slightly brighter pop than normal dialogue. |
| `negative` | Refusals, insults, cooldowns, disliked gifts, bad outcomes. | Red-tinted, italic text with sharper motion and angry villager particles. |
| `trade` | Completed trades and trade-like acknowledgements. | Compact mint-green text with happy/glow particles. Similar to `positive`, but a little more restrained. |
| `dialogue` | Conversation openings, greetings, questions, neutral gift text. | Soft purple text with subtle enchant particles. Good default for normal spoken snippets. |
| `sleep` | Sleeping breathing and dream murmurs. | Light blue, longer-lived sleepy text. Special-cases `ZZZ` into drifting `Z` letters and `*snores*` into snore bubble particles. |

The built-in default colors are roughly: `alert` yellow, `murmur` pale gray, `positive` green, `negative` red, `trade` mint, `dialogue` soft purple, and `sleep` light blue.

## Built-In Trigger Families

The built-in notification file uses these trigger families:

| Family | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| Gift HUD | `gift.liked`, `gift.neutral`, `gift.disliked`, `gift.received_item` |
| Gift world text | `gift.high_reputation`, `gift.world.liked`, `gift.world.neutral`, `gift.world.disliked` |
| Dialogue | `dialogue.greeting`, `dialogue.question`, `dialogue.cooldown`, `dialogue.joke.positive`, `dialogue.insult.negative` |
| Discovery | `dialogue.map.found`, `dialogue.rumor.found` |
| Recruitment | `recruitment.follow_start`, `recruitment.follow_stop`, `recruitment.hired`, `recruitment.fired`, `recruitment.follower_death`, `recruitment.hired_death`, `recruitment.betrayed_follower_death` |
| Reputation tiers | `reputation.tier.<level>.improved`, `reputation.tier.<level>.worsened` |
| Ambient | `ambient.murmur`, `ambient.player_item`, `ambient.sleep_breathing`, `ambient.sleep_murmur` |
| Combat | `combat.retaliation_started`, `combat.flee_started`, `combat.attack_landed`, `combat.player_killed` |
| Trade | `trade.completed`, `trade.refused` |
| Alerts | `alert.player_attacked_villager`, `alert.villager_damaged`, `alert.witness_attack.player`, `alert.witness_attack`, `alert.witness_death.player`, `alert.witness_death` |

See [Notification Triggers](Notification-Triggers.md) for simple and expanded dropdown examples for every built-in `trigger` value.

For reputation tiers, `<level>` is one of:

```text
royalty
revered
respected
trusted
neutral
suspicious
hostile
despised
feared
```

## Placeholders

Placeholder support depends on the trigger. Common built-in notification placeholders include:

```text
{item}
{target}
{villager}
{villager_possessive}
```

Unknown placeholders are left as literal text.

Player item filtered notifications can use `{player_item}`, `{held_item}`, `{player_item_id}`, `{held_item_id}`, `{player_item_slot}`, `{held_item_slot}`, `{player_item_durability}`, `{held_item_durability}`, `{player_item_max_durability}`, `{held_item_max_durability}`, `{player_item_damage}`, `{held_item_damage}`, `{player_item_durability_percent}`, `{held_item_durability_percent}`, `{player_item_enchantment}`, `{held_item_enchantment}`, `{player_item_enchantment_full}`, `{held_item_enchantment_full}`, `{player_item_enchantment_id}`, `{held_item_enchantment_id}`, `{player_item_enchantment_level}`, and `{held_item_enchantment_level}`. The aliases `player_item`, `player_item_tag`, `player_item_tags`, `player_item_slot`, `player_item_enchantment`, and `held_item_enchantment` are also accepted as fields.

Equipment-filtered notifications can use `requires_villager_armed` or `requires_villager_unarmed`, so the same trigger can show different text for armed defenders and empty-handed villagers.

Alert world text supports `{player}`, `{attacker}`, `{villager}`, `{villager_name}`, `{villager_kind}`, and `{profession}`. Use `alert.player_attacked_villager` for an immediate response from the damaged villager when the attacker is a player. If no entry matches, it falls back to `alert.villager_damaged`. Baby villagers can use the same alert triggers with `show_for_adults: false` and `show_for_babies: true`.

When a baby villager is damaged and an alert world-text line is emitted, the mod also sends a baby-specific villager chat line for the hit. Built-in data uses baby-only `alert.player_attacked_villager` and `alert.villager_damaged` entries for the in-world alert text.

`combat.retaliation_started` is emitted as world text when a villager or wandering trader acquires a new retaliation target. It supports `{target}`, `{target_name}`, `{target_kind}`, `{target_type}`, `{player}`, `{villager}`, `{villager_name}`, `{villager_kind}`, and `{profession}`. Use `target_entity_types` to target specific mobs or players.

`combat.flee_started` is emitted as world text when a villager keeps fleeing from a remembered hostile instead of standing ground. It supports the same placeholders and `target_entity_types` filter as `combat.retaliation_started`. This is useful for unarmed villager help lines.

`combat.attack_landed` is emitted as world text when a villager or wandering trader lands a damaging hit on a living target. It supports `{target}`, `{target_name}`, `{target_kind}`, `{target_type}`, `{player}`, `{villager}`, `{villager_name}`, `{villager_kind}`, and `{profession}`. Use `target_entity_types` to target specific mobs or players.

`combat.player_killed` is emitted as world text above the villager or wandering trader credited with killing a player. It supports `{player}`, `{victim}`, `{villager}`, `{villager_name}`, `{villager_kind}`, and `{profession}`.

`alert.witness_death.player` and `alert.witness_death` can be shown by baby witnesses when `retaliation.babyVillagersFleeWitnessedDeaths` is enabled. Built-in data keeps adult and baby witness-death alert text separate with `show_for_babies` / `show_for_adults` filters.

## Ambient World Text Example

```json
{
  "notifications": [
    {
      "id": "my_pack.ambient.farmer.trusted",
      "trigger": "ambient.murmur",
      "text": "The fields know that one",
      "world_text_kind": "murmur",
      "color": "#E9EEF5",
      "professions": ["farmer"],
      "reputation_levels": ["trusted", "respected", "revered", "royalty"],
      "weight": 25,
      "chance": 0.5
    }
  ]
}
```

## Player Item Example

```json
{
  "notifications": [
    {
      "id": "my_pack.sword_warning",
      "trigger": "ambient.player_item",
      "text": "Easy with {held_item}.",
      "world_text_kind": "alert",
      "color": "#FFD166",
      "player_items": ["#minecraft:swords"],
      "player_item_slots": ["main_hand"],
      "weight": 20
    }
  ]
}
```

## Translation Overlay Example

```json
{
  "notifications": [
    {
      "id": "my_pack.gift.liked",
      "trigger": "gift.liked",
      "text": "Bon cadeau: {item}",
      "kind": "gift_liked",
      "color": "green"
    }
  ]
}
```

Use the same `id` as the fallback entry to replace it for that locale.
