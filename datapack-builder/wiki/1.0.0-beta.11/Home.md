# Villager Retaliation Wiki

Villager Retaliation is data-driven in the places pack makers usually want to touch: dialogue, forced dialogue events, notifications, gifts, pacification payments, profession loot, story discoveries, villager names, and combat villager models. This wiki is written for JSON authors, datapack authors, resource-pack authors, and modpack developers who want predictable hooks without touching Java.

## Recommended Reading Order

1. Start with [Pack Development Guide](Pack-Development.md) for where files go and how packs layer.
2. Read [JSON Reference](JSON-Reference.md) for common field rules.
3. Jump to the page for the system you want to change.
4. Use [Example Packs](Example-Packs.md) as a starter and trim it down.

## Compatibility Notes

Villager Retaliation is built around vanilla villager systems. The JSON files in this wiki add, replace, or filter mod-provided data; they do not register new villager professions, items, entities, structures, or biomes by themselves. Use normal Minecraft datapack, resource-pack, or mod systems for that, then reference the resulting ids from Villager Retaliation JSON.
