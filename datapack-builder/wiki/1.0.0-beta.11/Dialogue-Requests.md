# Dialogue Requests

Dialogue options and response lines use separate fields so author intent stays clear:

- `options[].type` must be `dialogue_option`, which means the entry appears as a selectable talk-menu choice.
- `options[].request` chooses the response pool or built-in system request sent when the player clicks that option.
- `lines[].request` chooses which response pool a line belongs to.

For a custom option, the option `id` and the line `option` / `option_ids` should usually be paired. Built-in options such as `adult_share_story` can be targeted directly by addon lines.

Examples use `text` for compactness. Any dialogue line example can use `lines` instead when several variations share the same filters and weight.

Request values are case-insensitive in code, but lowercase snake case is recommended.

```json
{
  "options": [
    {
      "id": "my_pack.ask_weather",
      "label": "Ask About Weather",
      "type": "dialogue_option",
      "request": "question"
    }
  ],
  "lines": [
    {
      "id": "my_pack.weather.clear",
      "option": "my_pack.ask_weather",
      "request": "question",
      "text": "Clear skies make honest roads."
    }
  ]
}
```
