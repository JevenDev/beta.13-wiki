# Forced Dialogue JSON

Forced dialogue JSON controls event-driven conversation moments and event-driven villager chat lines. Use it for scenes like a villager catching the player stealing from a village chest, sending a villager-styled chat warning when retaliation starts, or stopping to warn the player just before retaliation turns into a fight.

## Paths

Forced dialogue files must be in the `villagerretaliation` namespace:

```text
data/villagerretaliation/forced_dialogue/default.json
data/villagerretaliation/forced_dialogue/my_pack_events.json
```

Use a unique file name for addon entries. A datapack file at `data/villagerretaliation/forced_dialogue/default.json` replaces the mod's built-in default file at the Minecraft resource layer, so only use that exact path when you intentionally want a full-file override.

Forced dialogue text is server-side datapack text. Button labels and villager responses in forced dialogue entries are not resource-pack language keys.

## Top-Level Shape

A forced dialogue file can be a single entry:

```json
{
  "id": "my_pack.theft_warning",
  "trigger": "container_theft",
  "output": {
    "mode": "forced_dialogue"
  },
  "lines": [
    "Stop right there.",
    "I saw what you took.",
    "That chest was not yours to empty."
  ]
}
```

or an `entries` array:

```json
{
  "entries": [
    {
      "id": "my_pack.theft_warning",
      "trigger": "container_theft",
      "output": {
        "mode": "forced_dialogue"
      },
      "lines": [
        "Stop right there.",
        "I saw what you took.",
        "That chest was not yours to empty."
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

| `options` | array | generated Leave option | Choices shown in the forced dialogue screen. |
| `leave_option` | object | generated Leave option | Outcome used by the visible Leave choice, Escape, and unexpected client closes. Uses the same fields as an option except the id is always `leave`. |
| `leave_options` | array | generated theft return options for `container_theft`, otherwise generated Leave option | Reputation-filtered Leave/Escape outcomes. The first matching option by `order` is used. |

When multiple entries match, lower `priority` wins. If priority is tied, an entry with matching `loot_table` or `loot_tables` wins over a generic entry.

Use `lines` when an event can happen often. The selected line is resolved through the same placeholders as `line`, so variations can reference `{stolen_stack}`, `{container}`, `{villager}`, and the other forced-dialogue tokens.

Use `chance` when a callout should be occasional. If the chance roll fails, the event stays silent and does not fall through to lower-priority entries.

## Output Modes

Use `output.mode` to choose how the event line is delivered. This keeps the event trigger focused on what happened and the output focused on how players see it.

| Mode | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `forced_dialogue` | Opens the locked interaction screen when `initiate_dialogue` is true. This is the default. |
| `chat` | Sends the line as villager-styled chat without opening the interaction screen. |

`output.radius` controls how far chat output is broadcast from the speaking villager. If omitted, the configured forced-dialogue chat distance is used. `retaliation_started` chat output can respond to player or non-player retaliation targets. For example, a villager can speak when retaliation starts:

```json
{
  "id": "my_pack.retaliation_warning",
  "trigger": "retaliation_started",
  "lines": [
    "You should have stayed away, {player}.",
    "The village remembers what you did.",
    "No more warnings."
  ],
  "output": {
    "mode": "chat",
    "radius": 24
  }
}
```

Use the same trigger with different `output.mode` values when an event should both emit a chat callout and open a locked forced-dialogue scene. Chat entries can play first, then a separate `forced_dialogue` entry for the same trigger can still run.

For direct reactions that should require an actual witness, prefer a forced-dialogue entry with `output.mode: "chat"` over ambient notification text. That gives the reaction access to `witness_radius`, `requires_line_of_sight`, witness profession filters, chance, priority, and target filters while still delivering the result as normal villager chat instead of opening the interaction screen.

Use `trigger: "player_item_proximity"` for held or worn item reactions when a player walks near a villager. The trigger requires a `player_items` or `player_item_tags` filter so it does not fire for every nearby player:

```json
{
  "id": "my_pack.diamond_sword_warning",
  "trigger": "player_item_proximity",
  "player_items": ["minecraft:diamond_sword"],
  "player_item_slots": ["main_hand"],
  "witness_radius": 8,
  "requires_line_of_sight": true,
  "lines": [
    "Easy with {held_item}, {player}.",
    "That blade is hard to miss.",
    "Keep {held_item} pointed away from the village."
  ],
  "output": {
    "mode": "chat",
    "radius": 16
  }
}
```

Durability filters can split item callouts into threshold-style branches. Use `priority` when ranges overlap, or use `max_player_item_durability` / `max_player_item_durability_percent` to make ranges exclusive:

```json
{
  "entries": [
    {
      "id": "my_pack.netherite_sword_fresh",
      "trigger": "player_item_proximity",
      "priority": 0,
      "player_items": ["minecraft:netherite_sword"],
      "player_item_slots": ["main_hand"],
      "min_player_item_durability": 500,
      "line": "{held_item} still has {held_item_durability} durability. That blade is ready.",
      "output": { "mode": "chat" }
    },
    {
      "id": "my_pack.netherite_sword_usable",
      "trigger": "player_item_proximity",
      "priority": 1,
      "player_items": ["minecraft:netherite_sword"],
      "player_item_slots": ["main_hand"],
      "min_player_item_durability": 200,
      "max_player_item_durability": 499,
      "line": "{held_item} has {held_item_durability} durability left. Mend it soon.",
      "output": { "mode": "chat" }
    },
    {
      "id": "my_pack.netherite_sword_low",
      "trigger": "player_item_proximity",
      "priority": 2,
      "player_items": ["minecraft:netherite_sword"],
      "player_item_slots": ["main_hand"],
      "max_player_item_durability": 199,
      "line": "{held_item} is nearly spent. Do not trust it with a long fight.",
      "output": { "mode": "chat" }
    }
  ]
}
```

Enchantment filters can be plain ids with shared top-level level bounds, or objects with per-enchantment bounds:

```json
{
  "id": "my_pack.sharp_weapon",
  "trigger": "player_item_proximity",
  "priority": 0,
  "player_items": ["#minecraft:swords"],
  "player_item_slots": ["main_hand"],
  "player_item_enchantments": [
    {
      "id": "minecraft:sharpness",
      "min_level": 3
    }
  ],
  "line": "{held_item} carries {held_item_enchantment_full}. That edge has intent.",
  "output": { "mode": "chat" }
}
```

If a `container_theft` entry does not define `leave_option` or `leave_options`, the generated default Leave outcome takes the stolen stacks back with `villager_inventory_then_source_container`, applies a reputation penalty, and rolls an aggro chance based on reputation: trusted or better is low risk, neutral/suspicious is moderate risk, and hostile/despised/feared is high risk.

## Option Fields

| Field | Type | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | required | Choice id. Must be unique within the entry. |
| `label` | string | required | Button text shown to the player. |
| `response` | string | none | Villager response after the player chooses this option. When `responses` is also set, this is included as the first possible variation. |
| `responses` | array | none | Additional villager response variations for this option. One response is selected at random. |
| `reputation` | integer | `0` | Reputation change applied after this option. |
| `aggro` | boolean | `false` | Makes the villager attack after this option. |
| `aggro_chance` | number | `0.0` | Chance from `0.0` to `1.0` that the villager attacks after this option. |
| `end_conversation` | boolean | `true` | Closes the forced dialogue after this option. |
| `order` | integer | option index | Sort order in the locked option list. |
| `reputation_level` | string or array | any | Alias for `reputation_levels`. |
| `reputation_levels` | string or array | any | Shows this option only for the player's current reputation tier with the witnessing villager. |
| `min_reputation` | integer | none | Minimum exact reputation value with the witnessing villager. |
| `max_reputation` | integer | none | Maximum exact reputation value with the witnessing villager. |
| `take_items` | object | none | Removes a configured payment from the player's inventory before the option succeeds. |
| `take_stolen_items` | boolean or object | none | For `container_theft`, removes the specific item stacks stolen from the source container before the option succeeds. |

Use reputation filters on entries to swap the whole event by rank, or on options to change the choices available inside one event. For example, the built-in container opening prompts only catch neutral and suspicious players on opening, hostile/despised/feared players get harsher opening responses, and trusted or better players can open watched containers until they actually remove items.

Escape does not bypass forced dialogue. Pressing Escape activates the entry's matching `leave_option` / `leave_options` outcome, so pack makers can attach response text, reputation changes, stolen-item returns, aggro chance, or other outcomes to leaving.

### `take_items`

Forced dialogue options can take items from the player before applying the option's normal response, reputation, aggro, and end-conversation behavior.

```json
{
  "id": "offer_payment",
  "label": "Offer payment",
  "response": "That will help replace what you disturbed.",
  "take_items": {
    "items": [
      "minecraft:emerald"
    ],
    "count": 8,
    "destination": "villager_inventory",
    "overflow_destination": "drop_at_villager",
    "success_response": "Eight emeralds is enough for me to believe you mean it.",
    "failure_response": "You do not have eight emeralds to offer.",
    "failure_reputation": -2,
    "failure_end_conversation": false
  },
  "reputation": 2,
  "end_conversation": true
}
```

`take_items` accepts `item` or `items`, plus `tag` or `tags`. Tags can also be written with a `#` prefix inside `items`. `count` is the total number removed across matching stacks, so `128` removes two full stacks when enough items exist. The removal checks the player's inventory and offhand, and transferred stacks keep their item components.

`destination` controls where removed items go:

| Value | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `discard` | Removes the items from the player. This is the default. |
| `villager_inventory` | Moves the items into the witnessing villager's inventory. |
| `villager_inventory_then_source_container` | Moves as much as possible into the witnessing villager's inventory, then returns the rest to the source container. |
| `source_container` | Moves the items into the container that started the forced dialogue. |
| `drop_at_villager` | Drops the items at the witnessing villager. |
| `drop_at_container` | Drops the items at the source container. |

When the destination is an inventory or container, `require_space` defaults to `true`, so the option fails unless the full payment can fit. Set `overflow_destination` to a drop or discard destination to allow overflow while keeping the payment successful.

`villager_inventory_then_source_container` first tries to put returned items into the witnessing villager's inventory, then puts any remainder back into the source container. This is useful for stolen-item return choices.

Payment outcomes can use `success_response` / `success_responses` and `failure_response` / `failure_responses`. When both the singular and array forms are present, the singular response is included as the first possible variation.

If the player does not have enough matching items, the normal option response and reputation do not apply. Instead, `failure_response`, `failure_responses`, `failure_reputation`, `failure_end_conversation`, and `failure_aggro` control what happens. Leaving `failure_end_conversation` false keeps the forced dialogue open so the player can choose another response.

### `take_stolen_items`

`take_stolen_items` is for `container_theft` options such as "Return it". It removes the exact item stacks that were missing from the container snapshot. It can be `true` for defaults, or an object with these fields:

| Field | Type | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `destination` | enum | `villager_inventory_then_source_container` | Where the returned stolen items go. |
| `overflow_destination` | enum | none | Optional fallback if the destination leaves a remainder. |
| `require_space` | boolean | `true` | Fails unless the destination can accept the items. |
| `success_response` | string | option `response` | Response after the stolen items are successfully removed. When `success_responses` is also set, this is included as the first possible variation. |
| `success_responses` | array | none | Additional successful-return response variations. |
| `failure_response` | string | none | Response if the player no longer has the stolen items. When `failure_responses` is also set, this is included as the first possible variation. |
| `failure_responses` | array | none | Additional failed-return response variations. |
| `success_reputation` | integer | `0` | Extra reputation change after a successful return. |
| `failure_reputation` | integer | `0` | Reputation change after a failed return. |
| `failure_end_conversation` | boolean | `false` | Closes the forced dialogue after a failed return. |
| `failure_aggro` | boolean | `false` | Makes the villager attack after a failed return. |

## Triggers

### `container_theft`

Fires when a player opens a watched container and closes it with fewer items than it had when opened.

### `container_opened`

Fires when a player opens a watched container. This trigger is used when the server config's container forced-dialogue trigger is set to `OPENING`.

The built-in default pack gates opening prompts by reputation: neutral and suspicious players are stopped with the standard warning before they can continue browsing, hostile/despised/feared players get more severe warnings, and trusted or better players can open watched village containers without an opening prompt. Taking items still triggers `container_theft` for every rank.

### `container_broken`

Fires when a player breaks a watched container, using the same watched-container eligibility as opening/theft checks. Like piglin guarded-container anger, the block break itself can provoke a response; unlike piglins, matching entries still use Villager Retaliation's witness filters and `requires_line_of_sight` rules.

When a `container_broken` entry matches, the mod applies the configured `containerBreakReputationLoss` to the witnessing villager. If the container has a generated loot table, the mod unpacks it before the break snapshot and also applies `generatedContainerBreakItemReputationLoss` once per dropped item count. Any `reputation` value on the forced-dialogue entry is added on top of that built-in penalty.

Watched containers:

```text
chests
barrels
shulker boxes
```

The built-in events require a villager witness with line of sight to the player and the container block. If no adult villager can witness the event, no forced dialogue starts.

Server config controls whether generated watched containers trigger on actual theft or on opening. By default, Villager Retaliation watches `OPENING`, so the built-in village chest confrontation fires when a player opens a generated village chest. The mod records the container's original loot table the first time it sees one, allowing later opens to keep matching generated-container forced dialogue after Minecraft unpacks and clears the live loot table. Servers can switch back to theft-only behavior.

Generated-container detection initially checks for an unresolved loot table through Minecraft's `RandomizableContainer` interface, so modded generated containers can participate when they expose loot tables the same way vanilla generated containers do.

The built-in `default.json` includes village-specific entries for vanilla village chest loot tables, plus lower-priority generic theft and break fallbacks for packs or configs that still want broad detection.

### `retaliation_started`

Fires when a villager acquires a new retaliation target and that target is the current player. This lets datapacks intercept the moment just before combat fully commits, so a villager can warn, accuse, demand payment, or go straight to violence depending on the selected entry.

`retaliation_started` uses the retaliating villager as the witness, so `witness_profession`, `requires_witness_unarmed`, `requires_witness_armed`, `requires_line_of_sight`, `witness_radius`, `target_entity_type`, `target_entity_types`, `min_recent_retaliations`, and `max_recent_retaliations` are the most relevant filters. Because forced dialogue is player-facing, this trigger currently only starts a forced conversation when the retaliation target is a player.

Use `trigger: "retaliation_started"` with `output.mode: "chat"` for a separate chat line on the same event. Chat output can also fire for non-player targets and broadcasts that line to nearby players.

Forced dialogue entries can optionally filter by generated container loot table:

```json
{
  "id": "examplepack.armorer_chest_opened",
  "trigger": "container_opened",
  "witness_professions": [
    "armorer"
  ],
  "loot_tables": [
    "minecraft:chests/village/village_armorer"
  ],
  "lines": [
    "That chest belongs to the armorer.",
    "Close the armory chest. Those supplies are counted."
  ],
  "force_camera_towards_villager": true
}
```

## Placeholders

Forced dialogue `line`, `lines`, option `response` / `responses`, `leave_option.response` / `leave_option.responses`, and payment or return outcome response text can use:

```text
{villager}
{player}
{target}
{target_name}
{target_kind}
{target_type}
{container}
{count}
{item}
{item_id}

{stolen_item}
{stolen_item_id}
{stolen_count}

## Behavior Notes

Forced dialogue opens the normal Villager Retaliation interaction screen in a locked mode. The player cannot navigate to Talk, Trade, Gift, Inventory, Recruit, Family, or Relationships from that moment; only the forced event options are available.

If `aggro_immediately` is true, the villager says the event line and attacks without opening the dialogue screen. If `initiate_dialogue` is false and `aggro_immediately` is false, the villager only says the event line. For event callouts that should never open the interaction screen, use `output.mode: "chat"`.
