# Dialogue JSON

Dialogue JSON controls conversation choices, villager replies, one-off messages, opening lines, closing lines, and pacification responses.

For event-driven locked conversations such as a villager catching the player stealing from a chest, see [Forced Dialogue JSON](Forced-Dialogue.md). Forced dialogue uses a separate datapack path and does not add normal Talk menu options.

## Paths

Dialogue files must be in the `villagerretaliation` namespace:

```text
data/villagerretaliation/dialogue/en_us/my_pack_dialogue.json
data/villagerretaliation/dialogue/en_us/groups/smiths.json
data/villagerretaliation/dialogue/en_us/professions/farmer.json
data/villagerretaliation/dialogue/en_us/professions/farmer/share_stories.json
data/villagerretaliation/dialogue/en_us/professions/examplemod/alchemist.json
data/villagerretaliation/dialogue/fr_fr/my_pack_dialogue.json
```

Files under `professions/<profession>.json` and `professions/<profession>/...json` automatically default entries to that profession unless the entry supplies its own `professions` filter. For custom professions, use `professions/<namespace>/<path>.json`; for example, `professions/examplemod/alchemist.json` defaults to `examplemod:alchemist`.

Shared group files, such as `groups/smiths.json`, are just normal dialogue files. Use them when one entry should apply to several professions, and keep the explicit `professions` filter on those entries.

Use a unique file name for addon dialogue. A datapack file at `data/villagerretaliation/dialogue/en_us/global.json` replaces the mod's built-in `global.json`, which can hide default interaction-menu options, keyed messages, openings, closings, and other built-in dialogue data. Only use that exact path when you intentionally want a full-file override.

Dialogue files translate villager speech and keyed dialogue messages. They do not translate the client GUI around the conversation, such as Talk, Trade, Gift, Gender, Mood, Family Tree, or generated relationship rows. Put those strings in a resource-pack language file; see [Localization Guide](Localization.md).

Files are read in sorted resource-location order. A file with top-level `"replace": true` clears previously loaded dialogue options, lines, messages, openings, closings, and pacify lines for that locale pool, then adds its own entries. Use this only when a pack intentionally wants to replace the loaded dialogue pool instead of adding to it.

## Top-Level Sections

A dialogue file can contain any mix of these arrays:

| Key | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `replace` | If `true`, clears previously loaded dialogue entries before this file is read. |
| `options` | Adds choices to the villager talk menu. |
| `lines` | Adds responses selected for a dialogue request type. |
| `messages` | Adds keyed one-off text used by specific systems. |
| `openings` | Adds conversation opening lines. |
| `closings` | Adds conversation closing lines. |
| `pacify` | Adds lines shown when pacifying a hostile villager. |

## Minimal Option And Line

```json
{
  "replace": false,
  "options": [
    {
      "id": "my_pack.ask_weather",
      "label": "Ask About Weather",
      "type": "dialogue_option",
      "request": "question",
      "order": 40
    }
  ],
  "lines": [
    {
      "id": "my_pack.weather_rain_farmer",
      "option": "my_pack.ask_weather",
      "request": "question",
      "weather": [
        "rain"
      ],
      "text": "Good for wheat, bad for boots.",
      "weight": 20
    }
  ]
}
```

The option id is what the player clicks. The line's `option` or `option_ids` links it to that choice.

## Add, Override, Or Replace

Most packs should add entries without `replace`. This keeps the built-in dialogue and adds your option:

```json
{
  "options": [
    {
      "id": "examplepack.ask_local_rumors",
      "label": "Ask Local Rumors",
      "type": "dialogue_option",
      "request": "story",
      "order": 30,
      "show_for_babies": false
    }
  ]
}
```

To override one entry, use the same `id` as an existing entry. Later files replace earlier entries with the same id:

```json
{
  "openings": [
    {
      "id": "global_new_villager_opening",
      "first_conversation_only": true,
      "show_for_babies": false,
      "text": "New face. State your business."
    }
  ]
}
```

Top-level `replace` is file-wide, not entry-wide. This file removes the earlier dialogue pool, then adds only one option:

```json
{
  "replace": true,
  "options": [
    {
      "id": "examplepack.ask_local_rumors",
      "label": "Ask Local Rumors",
      "type": "dialogue_option",
      "request": "story",
      "order": 30,
      "show_for_babies": false
    }
  ]
}
```

After that example, built-in options such as Greet, Ask Question, Tell Joke, and Insult are gone unless this file also adds them back. It also clears earlier `lines`, `messages`, `openings`, `closings`, and `pacify` entries. Use `replace: true` for total conversion packs, not for one extra option.

Quick choices:

| Goal | Use |
| --- | --- |
| Add one new talk option | No `replace`; add an `options` entry. |
| Add new villager replies | No `replace`; add `lines`, `messages`, `openings`, or `closings`. |
| Change one known built-in entry | Reuse that entry's `id`. |
| Replace all loaded dialogue with your own set | Top-level `"replace": true`, then include every entry you still want. |

## Text And Line Variations

Dialogue entries that output speech can use either `text` for one line or `lines` for several equal line variations. This applies to `lines`, `messages`, `openings`, `closings`, and `pacify` entries. The entry is selected by its normal `weight` first; if it has `lines`, one variation is then selected at random. Built-in beta.11 dialogue uses `lines` with at least three variants for most spoken entries to keep repeated conversations fresher.

Use `lines` when several entries would otherwise have the same filters and weight:

```json
{
  "lines": [
    {
      "id": "my_pack.weather_rain_farmer",
      "option": "my_pack.ask_weather",
      "request": "question",
      "weather": [
        "rain"
      ],
      "lines": [
        "Good for wheat, bad for boots.",
        "Rain keeps the fields honest.",
        "The rows will like this more than travelers do."
      ],
      "weight": 30
    }
  ]
}
```

Older `text` entries still work and are still clearer for single-line entries.

## Dialogue Requests

Use these values in `options[].request` and `lines[].request`:

```text
greeting
question
gift_preferences
gift_advice_followup
map_report
story_hint_report
combat_survival_report
gear_report
recruitment_followup
cured_recognition
village_event_report
apology
village_defense_report
story
share_story
joke
insult
```

`small_talk` has been removed as a separate request. Use `question` for general player-selected conversation.

See [Dialogue Requests](Dialogue-Requests.md) for simple and expanded dropdown examples for every current request value.

Reputation filters on options and lines check the player's current reputation with the specific villager being spoken to. Use `reputation_levels` for tier-based behavior, or `min_reputation` / `max_reputation` when you need an exact numeric boundary.

Player item filters can also use aliases `player_item`, `player_item_tag`, `player_item_tags`, and `player_item_slot`. Dialogue text can use `{player_item}`, `{held_item}`, `{player_item_id}`, `{held_item_id}`, `{player_item_slot}`, `{held_item_slot}`, `{player_item_durability}`, `{held_item_durability}`, `{player_item_max_durability}`, `{held_item_max_durability}`, `{player_item_damage}`, `{held_item_damage}`, `{player_item_durability_percent}`, `{held_item_durability_percent}`, `{player_item_enchantment}`, `{held_item_enchantment}`, `{player_item_enchantment_full}`, `{held_item_enchantment_full}`, `{player_item_enchantment_id}`, `{held_item_enchantment_id}`, `{player_item_enchantment_level}`, and `{held_item_enchantment_level}` when the selected line has a player item filter.

Dialogue options can use `give_items` when selecting the option should hand item(s) to the villager. It accepts `item` or `items`, plus `tag` or `tags`, and `count` / `amount`. The option only appears while the player can supply the item. `destination` can be `villager_inventory`, `discard`, or `drop_at_villager`; `give_items` defaults to `villager_inventory`, while the aliases `take_items` and `payment` default to `discard`. `store_in_villager_inventory: true` is accepted as a boolean shortcut for `destination: "villager_inventory"`. When `require_space` is true, the option fails if the destination cannot accept the full hand-in. Use `failure_response` / `failure_responses` for a missing-item or no-space line, and `success_response` / `success_responses` when the option should use a direct response instead of the normal matching dialogue line.

Successful item hand-in text can use `{payment_count}`, `{payment_items}`, `{payment_item}`, `{payment_item_id}`, `{payment_stack}`, `{given_count}`, `{given_item}`, `{given_item_id}`, `{given_stack}`, and `{given_items}`.

Family-aware dialogue text can use `{parent}`, `{sibling}`, `{spouse}`, `{child}`, `{grandparent}`, `{ancestor}`, `{grandchild}`, `{descendant}`, `{aunt_uncle}`, `{cousin}`, `{niece_nephew}`, `{deceased_family}`, `{extended_relative}`, `{relative}`, and the matching `_possessive` variants.

Relationship-aware dialogue text can use `{partner}`, `{crush}`, `{dating_partner}`, `{fiance}`, `{romantic_spouse}`, `{ex_partner}`, `{late_partner}`, and the matching `_possessive` variants.

Recruitment memory lines can use `{follow_biome}` and `{follow_distance}`.

Container theft memory lines can use `{stolen_item}`, `{stolen_item_id}`, `{stolen_count}`, `{stolen_item_count}`, `{stolen_stack}`, `{stolen_container}`, `{stolen_loot_table}`, `{theft_witness}`, and `{theft_witness_possessive}`. Use `player_event_tags: ["player_container_theft"]` to target the memory, then add `requires_container_theft_to_self` for lines like "my {stolen_item}" or `requires_container_theft_from_other` for gossip like "{theft_witness} told me about {stolen_stack}."

Retaliation memory lines can use `{retaliation_target}`, `{retaliation_target_name}`, `{retaliation_target_kind}`, `{retaliation_target_type}`, `{retaliation_witness}`, and `{retaliation_witness_possessive}`. Use `event_tags: ["villager_retaliation_started"]` for village gossip, `player_event_tags: ["villager_retaliation_started"]` when the current player was the target, and add `requires_retaliation_to_self`, `requires_retaliation_from_other`, or `retaliation_target_entity_types` when you want direct/self-or-other or mob-type-specific lines.

      "request": "question",
      "option": "my_pack.show_nether_star",
      "text": "That is no ordinary light. I will keep {given_item} safe."
    }
  ]
}
```

{
  "lines": [
    {
      "id": "my_pack.low_rep_warning",
      "request": "question",
      "reputation_levels": [
        "hostile",
        "despised",
        "feared"
      ],
      "text": "People here still remember what you cost us.",
      "weight": 20
    }
  ]
}
```

See [Event Tags](Event-Tags.md) for simple and expanded dropdown examples for every current tag, plus notes on which tags are currently remembered by built-in handlers.

Lines that use `player_cured_villager` can use:

```text
{cured_villager}
{cured_villager_possessive}
```

## Messages

Messages are keyed text looked up by code:

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "id": "my_pack.bed_warning_farmer",
      "key": "sleep.broken_bed",
      "text": "That was my bed. The field remembers every footprint.",
      "professions": [
        "farmer"
      ],
      "weight": 20
    }
  ]
}
```

Message fields:

| Field | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | generated | Use for translations and overrides. |
| `key` | string | required | Must match a key emitted by the mod. |
| `text` | string | required unless `lines` is set | Message text. |
| `lines` | array | required unless `text` is set | Alternate message texts. One is selected at random after this message entry wins weighted selection. |
| `professions` | string or array | inherited/any | Profession filter. |
| `dispositions` | string or array | any | Disposition filter. |
| `requires_villager_unarmed` | boolean | `false` | Requires the villager to have no usable weapon in either hand. |
| `requires_villager_armed` | boolean | `false` | Requires the villager to have a usable weapon in either hand. |
| `show_for_adults` | boolean | `true` | Adult visibility. |
| `show_for_babies` | boolean | `true`, or `false` on profession-filtered messages | Baby visibility. |
| `weight` | integer | `10` | Weighted selection. |

Gift preference rules can set `response_key` to point at any message key. Those custom gift messages can use `{gift_item}`, `{item}`, `{gift_item_id}`, and `{item_id}` placeholders. If the custom key has no matching message, the default reaction message is used instead.

## Openings And Closings

```json
{
  "openings": [
    {
      "id": "my_pack.opening_farmer_trusted",
      "text": "Good to see a steady face.",
      "professions": [
        "farmer"
      ],
      "dispositions": [
        "friendly",
        "respectful"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "closings": [
    {
      "id": "my_pack.closing_farmer",
      "text": "Mind the rows on your way out.",
      "professions": [
        "farmer"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Openings and closings support `id`, `text`, `lines`, `professions`, `dispositions`, `requires_villager_unarmed`, `requires_villager_armed`, `show_for_adults`, `show_for_babies`, `first_conversation_only`, `first_village_interaction_only`, and `weight`.

For `messages`, `openings`, and `closings`, entries with a profession filter default to adult-only unless they explicitly set `show_for_babies: true`. This keeps profession/job-site flavor from being selected for baby villagers by accident. Unfiltered entries still default to both adults and babies.

## Pacify Lines

```json
{
  "pacify": [
    {
      "id": "my_pack.pacify.accepted",
      "lines": [
        "Fine. {payment_cost} {payment_items}, and we try peace again.",
        "That pays for peace today. Do not make me price it twice."
      ],
      "outcomes": [
        "success"
      ],
      "weight": 10
    }
  ]
}
```

Pacify text supports:

```text
{payment_cost}
{payment_item}
{payment_items}
```

For older packs, `{emerald_cost}` still aliases `{payment_cost}`, and `{emeralds}` still aliases `{payment_items}`.

The `outcomes` field filters by the internal pacification result enum. If omitted, the line can match any result. Pacify lines also support `text`, `lines`, `professions`, `dispositions`, `requires_villager_unarmed`, `requires_villager_armed`, and `weight`.

Valid pacify outcomes are:

```text
not_applicable
success
not_enough_emeralds
blocked_by_reputation
```

## Story Placeholders

`share_story` lines can use:

```text
{target}
{target_article}
```

`{target}` is the configured structure or biome display name. `{target_article}` includes the article generated by the story system, such as "an Ancient City" or "a Deep Dark", and is capitalized automatically at sentence starts.

## Locale Overlay Example

English fallback:

```text
data/villagerretaliation/dialogue/en_us/my_pack_dialogue.json
```

```json
{
  "lines": [
    {
      "id": "my_pack.question.weather.clear",
      "request": "question",
      "text": "Clear skies make honest roads."
    }
  ]
}
```

French replacement:

```text
data/villagerretaliation/dialogue/fr_fr/my_pack_dialogue.json
```

```json
{
  "lines": [
    {
      "id": "my_pack.question.weather.clear",
      "request": "question",
      "text": "Un ciel clair rend les routes honnetes."
    }
  ]
}
```
