# Event Tags

Event tags are recent village-memory markers that dialogue lines can use with `event_tags` and `player_event_tags`.

Use `event_tags` when the line should react to something that happened near the villager or in their resolved village area. Use `player_event_tags` when the line should only react if the current player is attached to that remembered event. The memory window is short: current code keeps these events for about 10 minutes of game time, stores up to 80 events per dimension, and considers events in the village area or within roughly 48 blocks of the villager.

Enum values are case-insensitive in code, but lowercase snake case is the recommended datapack style.

```json
{
  "event_tags": [
    "raid"
  ],
  "player_event_tags": [
    "player_defended_raid"
  ]
}
```
